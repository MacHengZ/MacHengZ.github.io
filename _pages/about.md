I'm currently a forth year undergraduate student (BEcon) from [School of Economics](https://economics.nankai.edu.cn), [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn), and I'm going to [Department of Finance, Business school](https://www.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk/departments/finance/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) to join MSc in Finance programme in 2025. After that, I'll keep chasing my academic path by a doctoral programme (not apply prasently).

My research interests are Corporate Governance, International Business, MNEs, and Sustainable Development.
